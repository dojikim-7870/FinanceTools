## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a traditional multi-page website structure with shared navigation and styling components. Each financial category is organized into separate HTML pages (loans.html, income-tax.html, interest.html, assets.html, retirement.html, inflation.html) with dedicated sections for different calculator types. The architecture emphasizes code reusability through:

- **Shared Navigation Component**: Consistent navbar across all pages with responsive hamburger menu for mobile devices
- **Modular CSS Design**: Single stylesheet (styles.css) with component-based styling for consistent visual hierarchy
- **Utility-First JavaScript**: Common calculation functions and formatting utilities in script.js that can be reused across different calculators

### Responsive Design Pattern
The interface uses a mobile-first responsive design with:
- Flexible grid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Hamburger menu navigation for mobile devices
- Touch-friendly form controls and buttons
- Consistent spacing and typography across breakpoints

### Calculation Engine
Financial calculations are performed entirely client-side using JavaScript, providing:
- Immediate results without server round-trips
- Privacy protection since no financial data is transmitted
- Offline functionality once the page is loaded
- Standardized formatting for currency, percentages, and numerical outputs

### Page Structure Strategy
Each calculator category page follows a consistent structure:
- Page header with descriptive content
- Multiple calculator sections within the same category
- Input forms with validation
- Results display areas with professional formatting
- Educational content explaining calculation methodologies

### Performance Considerations
The architecture prioritizes fast loading and smooth user experience through:
- Minimal external dependencies
- Optimized CSS and JavaScript bundling
- Static file serving capabilities
- Efficient DOM manipulation for dynamic calculations

## External Dependencies

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with proper meta tags for SEO optimization
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with flexbox/grid layouts and responsive design principles
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies, using native DOM APIs and modern JavaScript features

### Browser APIs
- **Intl.NumberFormat**: International number formatting for currency and percentage display
- **DOM APIs**: Standard web APIs for form handling, event management, and dynamic content updates

### Development Tools
- **Static Hosting Ready**: Designed for deployment on static hosting platforms (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
- **SEO Optimized**: Proper meta descriptions, title tags, and semantic HTML structure for search engine visibility

### Third-Party Integrations
Currently, the application operates independently without external API dependencies, ensuring:
- Complete offline functionality
- No API rate limits or external service dependencies
- Fast performance regardless of third-party service availability
- Enhanced privacy protection for user financial data
